### Web Workers

Share data between workers

| Method                                                          | Cost                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Serialize data to string and deserialize it back another worker | serialization cost and double memory for same data |
| Structured Cloning Algorithm                                    | double memory for same data                        |
| Transferable Objects                                            | none                                               |

### **S**ingle **I**nstruction **M**ultiple **D**ata

[SIMD](https://01.org/node/1495) and [polyfill](https://github.com/johnmccutchan/ecmascript_simd)

```javascript
var v1 = SIMD.float32x4(3.14159, 21.0, 32.3, 55.55);
var v2 = SIMD.float32x4(2.1, 3.2, 4.3, 5.4);
var v3 = SIMD.int32x4(10, 101, 1001, 10001);
var v4 = SIMD.int32x4(10, 20, 30, 40);
SIMD.float32x4.mul(v1, v2); // [ 6.597339, 67.2, 138.89, 299.97 ]
SIMD.int32x4.add(v3, v4); // [ 20, 121, 1031, 10041 ]
```

### asm.js

Use special style of code to specify variable types and avoid performance penalty involving type coercions. Refer to [http://asmjs.org/](http://asmjs.org/).

asm.js is often a target for cross-compilation from other highly optimized program languages -- for example, [Emscripten](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/) transpiling C/C++ to javascript.

```javascript
var a = 42;
var b = a | 0; // this indicates b is always an integer
```

### Benchmark.js

Donald Knuth

> Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.

YDKJS

> Non-critical path optimization is the root of all evil. No amount of time spent optimizing critical paths is wasted, no matter how little is saved; but no amount of optimization on noncritical pathhs is justified, no matter how much is saved.
