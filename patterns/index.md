# Software Engineering

Topics

1. Design Patterns
1. SOLID Principles
1. Component Principles
1. Test Driver Development
1. Refactoring

The goal of both is to separate components that change for different reasons, and at different rates. The different reasons correspond to the actors; the different rates correspond to the different levels of policy.
