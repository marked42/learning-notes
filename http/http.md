## **U**niform **R**esrouce **I**dentifier

**Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)** is a string of characters used to identify a resource. Most commonly used form of URI is [**Uniform Resrouce Locator (URL)**](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#example-url-parsing), which identifies a resource by its address on the web, URL is informally referred as _web address_. **Uniform Resrouce Name** is a type of URI that identifies resource by name in particular namespace without implying its location or how to access it.

### Absolute and Relative URLs

URLs are divided into _absolute_ and _relative_ ones. _Absolute_ URL is complete and contains all information needed to locate a resource. _Relative_ URL is imcomplete and must be interpreted relative to a **base** URL to locate a resource.

Relative URL example below is interpreted as `http://www.joes-hardware.com/hammers.html`.

```html
<!--
Document(base): http://www.joes-hardware.com/tools.html
Relative URL Below
-->
<a href="./hammers.html">
```

Base URL can be specified implicitly or explicitly.

1. Explicit Base URL - Use `<base>` tag `href` attribute to specify explicitly.
    ```html
    <base target="_blank" href="http://www.example.com/page.html">
    ```
1. Implicit Base URL - Use URL of current document or resource as base URL.

Most browsers will try to expand URL into complete ones when users are typing or submitting URL. Two types of expandomatic URL are used usually.

1. Hostname expansion - User can type hostname `yahoo` only, browsers expand it into `www.yahoo.com`.
1. History expansion. When users are typing `http://www.youtube`, history URLs are used to expand it completely `http://www.youtube.com`.
